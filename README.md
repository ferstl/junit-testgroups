## Background
In a recent project we wanted to write each test as JUnit test no matter if the tests are real unit tests or longer running integration tests. The reason behind this idea is that everyone should be able to run all tests with Maven or directly within the IDE with as less effort as possible. Moreover, we wanted to prevent our CI build and also local Maven builds from executing the integration tests all the time (other CI jobs are executing them). So to make a long story short, we needed a mechanism to group our JUnit tests and to execute these groups of tests independently from each other.

There are already several tools that allow test grouping:
- JUnit's `Categories` runner
- Spring's `SpringJunit4ClassRunner` and its `@IfProfileValue` mechanism
- Maven's [Failsafe](http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-failsafe-plugin/) plugin
- ...

However, all of these tools have their disadvantages. We are not only using regular JUnit tests but also parameterized tests and Theories. Since these tests require different test runners, JUnit's `Categories` runner is not an option. Spring's `@IfProfileValue` mechanism is also not an option for the same reason and the maven-failsafe-plugin does not integrate well with IDEs. 

This project tries to achieve the same goals by using JUnit's class rule mechanism. It works pretty well but there are some pitfalls as well (see below).


## How to use

### Dependencies:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.github.ferstl</groupId>
      <artifactId>junit-testgroups</artifactId>
      <version>1.0.1</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
    
    <!-- JUnit will not come transitively with junit-testgroups! -->
    <dependency>
      <groupId>junit</groupId>
      <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
      <version>4.12</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>


### Grouping tests

First, annotate your tests with `@TestGroup` and declare the group to which the test belongs. In order to make the test groups work, you also need to define an instance of `TestGroupRule` as a class rule for each of your tests.

    @TestGroup("integration")
    public class MyIntegrationTest {
       @ClassRule
       public static TestGroupRule rule = TestGroupRule.create();
       
       ...
    }

A test may also belong to several groups:

    @TestGroup("group1", "group2")
    public class MyTest {
       @ClassRule
       public static TestGroupRule rule = TestGroupRule.create();
       
       ...
    }
    
Tests which don't declare a test group name are in an implicit default group. All tests belonging to the default group will run if no test group is defined (see "Running the Tests" below).
    
    @TestGroup
    public class MyRegularUnitTest {
      @ClassRule
      public static TestGroupRule rule = TestGroupRule.create();
    }

Instead of defining the same test groups and the class rules over and over again, a more practical approach is defining abstract test classes for all your supported test groups:

    @TestGroup("integration")
    public abstract class AbstractIntegrationTest {
      @ClassRule
      public static TestGroupRule rule = TestGroupRule.create();
      
      ...
    }
    
    public class MyIntegrationTest extends AbstractIntegrationTest {
      @Test
      public void testStuff() { ... }
    }


### Running the tests
Once your tests are grouped, you can run them by simply defining your test groups to be executed in a system property called `testgroup`:
- Execute a simple test group: `-Dtestgroup=integration`
- Execute multiple test groups: `-Dtestgroup=group1,group2`
- Execute all test groups: `-Dtestgroup=all`

When no `testgroup` system property is defined, all tests without an explicitly declared test group will be executed.
    

### More advanced Stuff
#### Using `TestGroupRule` together with other Test Rules
JUnit does not make any guarantees in which order test rules are evaluated. Consider this test:

    public class MyMultiRuleTest {
      @ClassRule
      public static TestGroupRule testGroupRule = TestGroupRule.create();
      
      @ClassRule
      public static TemporaryFolder tempDir = new TemporaryFolder();
      ...
    }

In this scenario it might happen, that the `tempDir` rule is evaluated before the `testGroupRule` and creates a temporary directory even if the test is not supposed to run.
To create an order between several `TestRule`s you need to use a `RuleChain`. `TestGroupRule` provides a convenience factory method for that:

    public class MyMultiRuleTest {
      @ClassRule
      public static TestRule rules = TestGroupRule.chain()
          .around(new TemporaryFolder());
      ...
    }

This guarantees the `TestGroupRule` to run first.

#### Testing with the Spring Framework
The Spring Framework has its own JUnit test runner called `SpringJUnit4ClassRunner`. When used together with the `TestGroupRule` this runner will always do some work before any JUnit test rules are executed. So this work is done even if the test is not supposed to run.
Since version 4.2 of the Spring Framework there is a [rule based alternative](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/integration-testing.html#testcontext-junit4-rules) to the `SpringJUnit4ClassRunner`. This allows it to create a rule `RuleChain`s as described above:

    @ContextConfiguration
    public class MySpringTest {
      @ClassRule
      public static TestRule classRules = TestGroupRule.chain()
          .around(new SpringClassRule());
      
      @Rule
      public MethodRule springMethodRule = new SpringMethodRule();
      
      ...
    }

#### Package Level Grouping
Test groups can also be defined on package level. However, the class rule still needs to be defined in your test classes.

    // package-info.java
    @TestGroup("integration")
    package my.project.integrationtests

#### Custom Test Group Key
In case the system property key `testgroup` does not work for you, you can define another key:

    @TestGroup(key = "mykey", value = "integration")
    public class MyIntegrationTest {
      @ClassRule
      public static TestGroupRule rule = TestGroupRule.create();
      
      ...
    }
    
Tests can then be executed with the system property `-Dmykey=integration`.

## The good Things
- Works with all test runners extending `ParentRunner`, which includes all test runners of the JUnit library (`BlockJUnit4ClassRunner`, `Parameterized`, `Theories`, `SpringJunit4ClassRunner`, etc.).
- Works with Maven **and** in your IDE
- All tests in the (implicit) default group will run without defining anything
- It's possible to run all tests no matter in what group they are

## The bad Things
- **All** tests require a `@TestGroup` annotation **and** an instance of `TestGroupRule` as `@ClassRule`. All other tests will be executed any time.
- There is no defined execution order of test rules. So if a test is in a test group and uses other test rules, these test rules might get executed even if the test is not supposed to run. You should use `RuleChain`s (with `TestGroupRule` as first rule) in case you are using other test rules.
- In case your test runner is a subclass of `ParentRunner`, the `#getChildren()` method of your test runner will **always** be executed, no matter if the test class is supposed to be executed.
